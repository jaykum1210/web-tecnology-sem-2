        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
    Hi! I’m <b>Jay</b>, a tech enthusiast who loves learning, coding, and building smart solutions that make life easier. I enjoy diving into programming, web development, and AI, always curious to explore new tools and trends in the tech world.
</p>

<p>
    I specialize in full stack web development using the <b>MERN stack</b> (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and have a strong interest in integrating AI into web platforms to make them smarter and more useful.
</p>

<p>
    Some of my favorite projects include online learning platforms, a medical appointment system, and a quiz app. One project I’m especially proud of helps students prepare for JEE, NEET, UPSC, and CLAT with simple and effective learning tools.
</p>

<p>
    I’m always growing as a developer and aim to become an expert in full stack development, AI, and cloud technology. I also love mentoring others, contributing to open-source, and sharing what I learn.
</p>

<h1>Hobbies and Interests</h1>
<p>
    In my free time, I enjoy solving logic puzzles, designing interfaces, learning new tech skills, and exploring how AI can be applied to real-world problems.
